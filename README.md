# C# Development Portfolio

Welcome to this portfolio of C# and .NET projects! Each repository below reflects core programming concepts ranging from object-oriented design to custom operator logic and polymorphic behavior.

## Projects Included

### 1. Polymorphism Demonstration
- **Overview**: This project demonstrates how polymorphism allows different classes to be treated through a common interface. The `Employee` class implements the `IQuittable` interface, and the functionality is triggered via a type-casted interface reference.
- **Core Topics**: Inheritance, Interfaces, Polymorphism.
- **Repository**: [Polymorphism Assignment Submission](https://github.com/furkanerataa/Polymorphism-Assignment-Submission)

---

### 2. Operator Overloading in Practice
- **Overview**: This example project highlights how C# allows developers to overload built-in operators. The `Employee` class overrides `==` and `!=` to compare employee IDs and also implements custom logic in `Equals` and `GetHashCode`.
- **Core Topics**: Operator Overloading, Object Comparison, Equality Logic.
- **Repository**: [Operators Assignment Submission](https://github.com/furkanerataa/Operators-Assignment-Submission)

---

### 3. Method and Class Implementation
- **Overview**: A project focusing on encapsulating logic into methods and structuring reusable classes. It showcases how to build static and instance methods, and use class-based architecture for clean code.
- **Core Topics**: Methods, Static vs. Instance, Class Structuring.
- **Repository**: [Method Class Assignment Submission](https://github.com/furkanerataa/Method-Class-Assignment-Submission)
